#Exercise 1: Hello World
#Instructions
#Print the following output using one line of code:

#Hello world
#Hello world
#Hello world
#Hello world

print("hello world\nhello world\nhello world\nhello world")

#Exercise 2: Some Math
#Instructions
#Write code that calculates the result of:
#
#(99^3)*8 (meaning 99 to the power of 3, times 8).

print((99**3)*8)

#Exercise 3: What is the output?
#Instructions
#Predict the output of the following code snippets:
#Coment what is your guess, then run the code and compare

5 < 3 #Guess:False
#(Terminal: >>> 5 < 3 False)

3 == 3 #Guess:True
#(Terminal: >>> 3 == 3 True)

3 == "3" #Guess:False
#(Terminal: >>> 3 == "3" False)

"3" > 3 #Guess:False
#(Terminal: >>> "3" > 3 TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int')

"Hello" == "hello" #Guess:False
#(Terminal: >>> "Hello" == "hello" False)

#Exercise 4: Your computer brand
#Instructions
#Create a variable called computer_brand which value is the brand name of your computer.
#Using the computer_brand variable, print a sentence that states the following:
#"I have a <computer_brand> computer."

computer_brand = "Dell"
print(f"I have a {computer_brand} computer.")


#Exercise 5: Your information
#Instructions
#Create a variable called name, and set it’s value to your name.
#Create a variable called age, and set it’s value to your age.
#Create a variable called shoe_size, and set it’s value to your shoe size.
#Create a variable called info and set it’s value to an interesting sentence about yourself. The sentence must contain all the variables created in parts 1, 2, and 3.
#Have your code print the info message.
#Run your code.

name = "Ariel"
age = 40
shoe_size = 44
info = f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and my shoe size is {shoe_size}."
print(info)
print("My name is " + name + ", I am " + str(age) + " years old, and my shoe size is " + str(shoe_size) + ".")

#Exercise 6: A & B
#Instructions
#Create two variables, a and b.
#Each variable’s value should be a number.
#If a is bigger than b, have your code print "Hello World".

a = 10
b = 5          
if a > b:
    print("Hello World")    
    
#Exercise 7: Odd or Even
#Instructions
#Write code that asks the user for a number and determines whether this number is odd or even.

#number=int(input("Please enter a number:"))
#if (number % 2 ==0):
 #   print("The number is even.")
#else:
   # print("The number is odd.")

#Exercise 8: What’s your name?
#Instructions
#Write code that asks the user for their name and determines whether or not you have the same name. Print out a funny message based on the outcome.
my_name = "Ariel"
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
if user_name == my_name:
    print("Wow, what a coindcidence")

    
#Exercise 9: Tall enough to ride a roller coaster

User_height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
if User_height > 145:
    print("You are tall enough to ride.")
else:
    print("You need to grow some more to ride.")
